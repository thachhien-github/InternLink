## Navigation rules

- A stored access token is validated through `/api/Auth/me` during bootstrap.
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`.
- A protected route remembers the requested path and returns there after login.
- Unknown portal routes fall back to that portal dashboard.
- Role mapping is defined in `frontend/src/lib/roleMap.ts`.
- Development Vite uses port `3000` according to `frontend/package.json`; production Docker also exposes `3000` through Nginx.
